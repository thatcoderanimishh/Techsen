Techsen- Smart Instruments for Indian Classical Music.


This is Techsen, A script that provides real-time background for Indian Classical music. The name Techsen is a combination of two words- Tansen, the best Hindustani classical in all of music history; infamous for his raags and bandishs and famous for being able to invoke natures element with the purity of his singing, and technology.


In Classical music(Indian Classical music), the instruments other than the main singer are what really amplify the feeling behind the emotions conveyed by the artist. For professionals, they can collaborate with other artists who play different instruments. But, for intermediates and beginners, to be able to do so with confidence amongst more skilled musicians is hard. This is the gap that Techsen intends to fill.

Techsen is a script that follows you, the main artist's lead in a particular Raag, correcting your mistakes and fitting it appropriately into the Raag as it goes. This is useful for beginners or people trying to learn a new Raag, as it can correct any mistakes made by the lead.
The python script can also be used to generate midi files or use soundfonts to emulate any and all instruments that the user desires. Any new raag can easily be taught to Techsen by updating the Raag dictionary in Techsen. All of these features are useful to help people with great talent but not a wide enough network of artists to perform with to perform their art with any instrument they chose. Techsen can be used in smaller to medium scale music institutions as a backbone and guidance to learning artists to learn about different chalans of different Raagas.

Users can add their own instruments by creating soundfonts which Techsen can use, thereby creating an infinite library of instruments that artists can create music with. Techsen is optimised to run on lower end hardware, meaning that an instance can easily be deployed on the cloud for easy public usage.
